									<h2>LRT vs. BRT Overview:</h2>
									<p><strong>LRT</strong> is an electric rail system with high capacity but high infrastructure and maintenance costs. Light Rail Transit (LRT) is a public rail transport system typically distinguished by fixed guideways, greater capacity for passengers, and higher costs of construction.</p>
									<p><strong>BRT</strong> offers similar service levels using buses on dedicated lanes at lower cost and greater flexibility. BRT schemes are flexible and scalable; they can be rolled out in phases and scaled up as passenger demand or opportunities for funding change.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Cost and Infrastructure:</h2>
									<p>LRT costs about $16–25 million/km and takes longer to build. BRT costs $3–8 million/km and can be deployed faster.</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Operational Performance:</h2>
									<p>BRT often matches or exceeds LRT in speed and frequency, especially when integrated with Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in other countries case study. For instance, research from cities such as Bogotá demonstrates that BRT can maintain average speeds that rival those of rail systems by avoiding traffic congestion.</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>User Satisfaction:</h2>
									<p>Studies show higher satisfaction with BRT due to frequency, comfort, and speed. LRT systems in Addis Ababa face overcrowding and unreliable schedules.</p>

									<h2>Case Studies:</h2>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Bogotá, Colombia: Bogotá's</strong> Trans Milenio system has set high standards for BRT performance by ensuring dedicated lanes, advanced ITS integration, and effective service frequency. The system's success is reflected in improved average speeds and high levels of user satisfaction.</li>
										<li><strong> Nairobi, Kenya:</strong> In other contexts, a well-implemented BRT has resulted in increased user approval ratings, sometimes showing up to an 80% approval rate compared to lower satisfaction levels with traditional transit systems, such as those seen with Addis Ababa's LRT.</li>
